<h1>WELCOME TO GIT</h1>
  <p>GitHub is primarily used for version control, collaboration, and project management in software development. It allows developers to store, track, and manage changes to code, and to collaborate on projects with others.
    GitHub also serves as a platform for open-source projects, facilitating 
    code sharing and community contributions. </p>
